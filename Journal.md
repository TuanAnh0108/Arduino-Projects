 ①　We brainstormed about how to make a type information with 2-button-keyboard.
  
  - First idea is, 2 buttons in the keyboard is next for moving to the keyboard we want and ok for choosing the letters. With this keyboard we cannot have mistake when typing becuase we cannot delete.
   
   - Second idea is, the letters are arranged in cycle, the 2 buttons are ok and delete. This solves the first idea's issues (can delete letters).
    
 ② We started to study about Arduino, downloaded the Arduino app offline and know about the online Arduino app.
 
 ③ We did the reflection about the Car Rental App.
 
 Questions I have: 
  - How the Arduino works?
  - Which programming language that Arduino is suitable with?
