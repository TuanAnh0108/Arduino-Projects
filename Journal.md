 ①　We brainstormed about how to make a type information with 2-button-keyboard.
  
  - First idea is, 2 buttons in the keyboard is next for moving to the keyboard we want and ok for choosing the letters. With this keyboard we cannot have mistake when typing becuase we cannot delete.
   
   - Second idea is, the letters are arranged in cycle, the 2 buttons are ok and delete. This solves the first idea's issues (can delete letters).
    
 ② We started to study about Arduino, downloaded the Arduino app offline and know about the online Arduino app.
 
 ③ We did the reflection about the Car Rental App.
 
 Questions I have: 
  - How the Arduino works?
  
  Compare Bash and Arduino programing languge
   
   | Bash | Arduino |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | In bash, the for loop use curly braces for the statement that need to repeat. There are 3 parameters in the curly braces: initialization, condition and increment. You do not need to declare the data type of variable that you will use in your code. Moreover, you have to use do when opening a statemen, done when closing the statement for the for loop. Next, at the end of the statement we do not need to use ";" to end the statement. When using a variable, you need to use "$" before the name of the variable. Then, to make a comment, you just use "#" to open a comment line. We use "echo" to print String or variable.| In Arduino,like bash we use curly braces for the statement that need to repeat. Also it has the same 3 parameters as in bash. You have to declare all the variable that you use in your program or it will cause errors. Next, the for loop just need to have open and close brackets for the statement. ";" is the compulsory thing in Arduino code, we have to use it to end the statement or it will cause errors. In the contrast of bash, arduino code does not require "$" when using variable. When making a comment, you need to open and close (using /* )the comment. We use "print" to print the string or variables |

①　We learn about the binary number and how to convert from decimal number to binary number

② We write code for counter the binary number from 1 to 15 and made the Arudino for the counter program

①　We explore about hwo the number segment works.

②　We write the equation for each light and made a Arduino for it
