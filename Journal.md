 ①　We brainstormed about how to make a type information with 2-button-keyboard.
  
  - First idea is, 2 buttons in the keyboard is next for moving to the keyboard we want and ok for choosing the letters. With this keyboard we cannot have mistake when typing becuase we cannot delete.
   
   - Second idea is, the letters are arranged in cycle, the 2 buttons are ok and delete. This solves the first idea's issues (can delete letters).
    
 ② We started to study about Arduino, downloaded the Arduino app offline and know about the online Arduino app.
 
 ③ We did the reflection about the Car Rental App.
 
 Questions I have: 
  - How the Arduino works?
     
Journal on 6/11/2019

①　We study about the function in the modern C program

② We write code for Traffic Light program and made it on Arduino

①　We learn about the binary number and how to convert from decimal number to binary number

② We write code for counter the binary number from 1 to 15 and made the Arudino for the counter program

①　We explore about hwo the number segment works.

②　We write the equation for each light and made a Arduino for it

③　At first, I did not find difficult when finding the equations and the code for the number segment, but I made a mistake when connecting the atot of the LED, and the resistor connect with the GND. After then, I came back home fixing the problems, and finally it works. 

The questions I have: I have LED lights that sometimes it work, sometimes it not works, I check everything change the LED, but after all it still not works. It is not sustainable. I cannot find the reasons why?

I start to design the input system with two buttons.

The questions I have: 
 + How to read the press button when we press it twice or hold it?
 + How we can delete the letter after choosing?
 + How to interupt the Arudino

 ①　I learned about the Human-centered design HCD and usability
 ②　I continue to complete the English input system 
 
 Questions I have: 
   + When run the debouncebutton function and the related code, why the LCD does not work? 

Journal on 02/12/2019

① I learned about the computer architecture
② We continue to finish the arduino english input system.

Journal on 11/12/2019

① We continue working on the transmitter
② I found out the way to convert English to binary (ASCII)

Journal on 6/1/2020

①　We learned about C an how it is similar to Arduino programming language

Journal on 8/1/2020

  We practice C exercises
